# Network Automation With Cloud Integration

### Work In Progress

This project showcases the implementation of network automation and cloud infrastructure management using Ansible, Terraform, and AWS. The primary focus is on orchestrating the provisioning and configuration of both on-premises and cloud resources.

## Project Highlights:

### Terraform Setup:

- Utilize Terraform to define infrastructure for local lab and cloud environment.
- Provision AWS resources (VPC, subnets, EC2 instances)

### Ansible Integration:

- Automate configuration of local network devices and AWS resources with Ansible.
- Coordinate Ansible playbooks seamlessly within Terraform provisioning.

### Dynamic Inventory Enhancement:

- Enhance Ansible's dynamic inventory script to dynamically fetch information about AWS instances.

### Advanced AWS Configurations:

- Leverage Terraform for advanced AWS setups like Auto Scaling Groups, Elastic Load Balancers, and S3 buckets.
- Manage EC2 instance software configurations using Ansible.

### Infrastructure Versioning:

- Implement version control for Terraform configurations using Git.
- Showcase infrastructure changes tracking and management.

### CI/CD Integration:

- Explore integrating CI/CD tools for automated testing and deployment of infrastructure changes.
